            It's cause you're the only one I'm really missing</br>
            Nobody else would be forgiving</br>
            Cause of all the love that you give me</br>
            All of the love that you give me</br>
            All of the love that you give me, give me</br>
            (Wishing I was better at this damn thing</br>
            Cause it's just been too long and I can't change)</br>

                When will I get over this, over this?
